//   script   screenplay text (plain or Fountain), parsed into scenes by screenplay.js

// step is where the person is in the Projects wizard (idea, story, cast, board, film, watch).
// Breaking the script down uses the local writer: one call per scene for the shot list, then one per shot
// for its H3 prompt. Rendering, picking and finishing are Studio's own.

const SHOT_RULES = `You are a film director breaking one scene of a screenplay into shots for an AI video model. Each shot is one continuous camera take of 3 to 10 seconds with native sound.
- Keep the scene's order. Cover its action within the seconds you are given for the scene: when there's more than fits, keep the moments that tell the story and every spoken line.
- Every line of dialogue appears in exactly one shot, word for word, and a shot has at most one speaker. A long speech can be split over shots, each with its own part.
- Open with a shot that shows where we are, then go closer when people talk or do something small.
- action: what we see, present tense, one or two concrete sentences: who, where, what they do and how. Name people by their names. No camera words here.
- A shot never cuts. Something like "close-up on her hand, then cut to a wide shot" is two shots: write them as two.
- staging: where each person is at the start of the shot by screen side (screen-left is the viewer's left, not the character's), which way they face, who they look at and how far apart they are, and where they move. With two people, keep the camera on one side of the line between them for the whole scene, so they stay on the same sides of the frame.
- camera: one shot size and the camera's movement (e.g. "Wide, slow push in", "Close-up, handheld"), never two sizes with an arrow. Choose the framing that shows the action: hands and the object for a small action, enough body and floor for a movement, the face for a reaction.
- ends: how the shot leaves things: where each person is and which way they face, where their hands and the important props are, who they look at and which way anyone is moving. The next shot starts from exactly that, unless the scene says otherwise.
- characters: the names of the people on screen (from the cast list, or as the script names them).
- speaker and line: who speaks in this shot and their exact words, or "" for both.
- seconds: 3 to 10. A spoken line needs about 1 second per 2.5 words plus 1 second.
- Don't add lines, people, props or camera moves the script doesn't have. A quiet reaction can carry a moment.`

const SCRIPT_RULES = `You write short films for an AI video model that films one 3 to 10 second shot at a time, with sound and spoken lines.
- Write the film the person describes, in plain, concrete, visual English. Show, don't explain.
- Keep the idea's own events, twist and ending exactly as given. Never swap them for a different or simpler story: if the idea says a puzzle is finished and then an extra piece turns up, the puzzle is finished and the piece is extra.
- Keep where people are and what they hold consistent from beat to beat: someone sitting on the floor doesn't push back a chair.
- Keep it small: few places, few people, simple physical actions the camera can see, short spoken lines.
- Use the cast's names for the people in it. Don't invent more than one extra person unless the idea needs them.
- Every scene happens in one place at one time. place is a short name ("Pottery studio"), time is DAY, NIGHT, MORNING or EVENING, inside is true for interiors, and looks is one sentence on what the place looks like (the room, the light, the colours).
- beats run in order. An action beat fills only action: one short sentence of what we see. A line beat fills speaker (a cast name), delivery (two or three words on how it's said, or "") and words: only what they say out loud, with no name, no quote marks and no "she says". Lines are short: one sentence.
- Write exactly the number of beats you are given, and end on a clear final image or line.

{"kind":"action","action":"Tess lifts a finished bowl off the wheel and turns it in the light.","speaker":"","delivery":"","words":""}
