    brief: `Make one H3 shot. Ask for whatever is missing: the idea, the character (list_characters), the mode (text, references, first/last frame, continue) and the length. Write the prompt with write_prompt (free local writer), show it, then generate_previews (usually 3) and poll get_job. Show the previews, let the person pick one, then finish it with finish_candidate.`

Follow the guide's Sequences section (save_sequence, then the one-take or shot-by-shot render), poll get_job, then offer a render out.`

    brief: `Make music. Ask for the style, mood and length, and whether it has lyrics (MiniMax Music 3 sings clearly; ACE-Step is quicker for instrumentals). Make it with make_music, then offer it for an edit or as a shot's sound.`

    brief: `Make a website sizzle. Ask for the address, then follow the guide's Website sizzle section: capture the site, write the storyboard and get the person's OK on it before anything renders, then make the pieces and the first cut.`
