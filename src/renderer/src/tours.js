// "How it works": a short guided tour of each page. Each step lights up a real part of the page (at: a CSS
// selector, or a list of them, the first one on screen wins) with a title and a line or two. A step whose part
// isn't on screen right now is skipped, so a tour fits whatever state the page is in. A step with no at shows
// in the middle of the window. Keep steps few and plain: they're read in passing.
//
// When a page changes, update its tour here in the same change (and FULL_TOUR if it visits that page), then run
// test/tours.mjs, which fails when a step points at a class or a step heading the code no longer has.
